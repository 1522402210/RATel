To prevent RATel from being detected by antivirus, please do not upload the payload to TOTAL VIRUS.
Each month I will test myself if the payload gets detected by antivirus.
So you’ll have a photo every month to prove RAtel’s discretion.

## Description

RAT-el is an open source penetration test tool that allows you to take control of a windows machine.
It works on the client-server model, the server sends commands and the client executes the commands and sends the result back to the server. 
The client is completely undetectable by anti-virus software.
